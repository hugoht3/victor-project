This is my website called ADD-ME which is a gaming news website that consists of 3 pages, my index page acts as an informative hub to introduce new visitors and subscribers as well as the main goal of the project which is video-games news. (releases, prices, curiosity, etc ...)



FEATURES 

Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation list includes links to the Home page, Gallery, and Sign Up page and is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation.

# The index page

On this first page, we have images to act as guides to set categories of games such as FPS (first Pearson shooter), Open world, and so on.

# The Footer

Links to all the popular social media that opens in new tabs for easy navigation for the user.

It counts towards the community's reach for more participants.







# The Community Screen Shots


The second page is a humble gallery for the subscribers, so they can share screenshots of their gameplay and have a hub to connect with others without saying a word.

A good place to find out more genres to add to you`re portfolio

Images that represent already users of the page and a picture of their experience.

# Main GOAL of the whole website

# The deployment 

A Total of 3 deployments:

The first was just to make sure all the things were correct.
The second was to fix all the things that were not correct.
I tried to have all my content shown as I wanted and checked all the links would be accessed.

The whole of the code was done in VSCODE and pushed to Git Hub, its pubic directory https://github.com/hugoht3/victor-project in the master branch. (go check it out :D).

The live link can be found here - https://hugoht3.github.io/victor-project/index.html
