This is my website called ADD-ME which is a gaming news website that consists of 3 pages, my index page acts as an informative hub to introduce new visitors and subscribers as well as the main goal of the project which is video-games news. (releases, prices, curiosity, etc ...)



FEATURES 

Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation list includes links to the Home page, Gallery, and Sign Up page and is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation.

# The index page

On this first page, we have images to act as guides to set categories of games such as FPS (first Pearson shooter), Open world, and so on.


The FPS (first-person shooter)![Alt text ](/assests/images/counter_strike_2_logo_characters.jpg)

The second page is a humble gallery for the subscribers, so they can share screenshots of their gameplay and have a hub to connect with others without saying a word.

A good place to find out more genres to add to you`re portfolio

Images that represent already users of the page and a picture of their experience.
